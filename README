App-PDF-Link

The pdflink tool inserts arbitrary file links into PDF documents.

When invoked without a --targets option, this program will process
the PDF document using the associated CSV as table of contents.

For every item in the PDF that has one or more additional files (files
with the same name as the title, but differing extensions), clickable
icons are added to the first page of the item. When clicked in a
suitable PDF viewing tool, the corrresponding file will be activated.

For example, if the CSV contains

  title;pages;
  Blue Moon;24;

And the following files are present in the current directory

  Blue Moon.html
  Blue Moon.mscz

Then two clickable icons will be added to page 24 of the document,
leading to these two files.

Upon completion, the updated PDF is written out under the specified name.

When invoked with the --targets option, all specified PDF files get
links inserted to the targets on the first page. If there is only one
PDF file you can use the --pdf option to designate the name of the
new PDF document, otherwise all PDF files are updated (rewritten.
